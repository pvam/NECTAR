				<b>1. What is NECTAR?</b><br>
				NECTAR, Nash Equilibriuam CompuTAtion Resource, is an open source
				software tool to compute the Nash equilibrium points of
				non-cooperative games.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>2. Why NECTAR?</b><br>
				Game theory is applicable in many areas  of computer science and
				economics. In all these problems, the central challenge is to find the
				equilibria. NECTAR is designed for computing the equilibrium points
				efficiently and effectively.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>3. What are the previous efforts?	</b><br>	
				<b>Gambit</b> is a library of game theory software and tools for the
				construction and analysis of finite extensive and strategic games available
				at <i> http://econweb.tamu.edu/gambit </i>.<br>
				<b>GameTracer</b> is an application for calculating Nash
				equilibria in strategic form games. It implements the global Newton method of
				Govindan and Wilson (2001), as well as their iterative polymatrix approximation
				algorithm available at <i>http://dags.stanford.edu/Games/gametracer.html</i>
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>4. How do you compare NECTAR with GAMBIT?</b><br>
				GAMBIT has not implemeted the newly published algorithms, but NECTAR has 
				algorithms which are recently published. 
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>5. How do you compare NECTAR with GAMETRACER?</b><br>
				GAMETRACER is for only strategic form games and implemented global
				Newton method and iteratively polynomical algorithms. Whereas, NECTAR is the 
				complete suite of algorithms for both strategic form and extensive form
				games.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>6. Which algorithms have been implemented?</b><br>
				Pure Nash equilibria, two-person zero-sum algorithm, Lemke-Howson
				algorithm, Mangasarian algorithm, simple search method, mixed integer
				programming, sequence form algorithm, and correlated equilibrium etc..
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>7. What are the platform details of NECTAR?</b><br>
				NECTAR is implemented in Java, which is object oriented, platform
				independent, and architectural-neutral language.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>8. What are the design patterns used in NECTAR?</b><br>
				Factory method, Singleton, Command, Facade, Mediator, and Adapter etc.,
				are used for NECTAR.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>9. What type of data structrues used for NECTAR?</b><br>
				Multidimensional array for strategic form games, and general tree
				structure for extensive form games.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>10. What are the other tools used for NECTAR?</b><br>
				For some algorithms, currently we used ILOG's CPLEX software tool for
				solving the set of linear equations. We also provided an interface in such way
				that can be easily adapted to any other linear programming solver with a
				suitable adapter class.
			</div>
			<div>
				<b>11. What is the input to the NECTAR?</b><br>
				Currently NECTAR takes all inputs in the form of files. NECTAR uses
				GAMBIT input format for both strategic form games and extensive form
				games.
