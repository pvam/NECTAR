Welcome, 

NECTAR Stands for "Nash Equilibria CompuTAtion Resource", it is an open source, platform-independent software tool for computing Nash equilibria of strategic form games and extensive form games. It also provides an environment where researchers can carry out experiments using different algorithms. The design and implementation of NECTAR has been carried out following best practices in object oriented software
engineering. 
Originally developed by Kalyana Chakravarthi under supervison of Prof. Y. Narahari. You can access his M.E theis at http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/gametheory/necter

Please go through "UserManuals" folder to see how to run this tool, there will be two seperate versions.
	1. Applet version, which is a jar file, you have download and execute with java.
	2. Web version, for which actual source code is provided here. Web version uses applet jar file as dependecy.

For the pupose of solving integer programming, we have used lpsolve.
